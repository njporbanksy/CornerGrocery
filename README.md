# CornerGrocery
Final Project for  CS210 

This application is an integration of Python & C++ which it successfully does. It will take an item list with repeated items to be counted into a histogram. It will also give individual item counts per request. 
In the prior application I had attempted at using a switch for menu selection and input validation but it didn't work as expected and I thought about trying that again but left inputs and validation as if statements. 
This will be my first puble published code on github so, that's cool.
